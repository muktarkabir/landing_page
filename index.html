            <div class="pic"><img src="assets/moon.jpeg" alt="picture of the moon"></div>
            <div class="fact">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of Earth's, making it the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar System.</div>

            <div class="fun-fact">
            <div class="pic"><img src="assets/carina-nebula.jpg" alt="carina-nebula"></div>
            <div class="fact">The Carina Nebula, NGC 3372, is an enormous cloud of gas and dust home to several massive and bright stars, including at least a dozen that are 50 to 100 times the mass of our Sun.Captured in infrared light by NASA's new James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="fun-fact">
            <div class="pic"><img src="assets/blackhole.png" alt="blackhole"></div>
            <div class="fact">A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. This is the first picture of a black hole.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="fun-fact">
            <div class="pic"><img src="assets/helix-nebula.jpeg" alt="helix-nebula"></div>
            <div class="fact">The Helix, located 650 light-years away, is one of the closest planetary nebulae to Earth. This glowing gas cloud appears very large in the sky: Its apparent size is about half the diameter of the full moon. (The Helix's actual diameter is about 2.5 light-years.)</div>
