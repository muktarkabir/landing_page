# landing_page
I've learned a good amount of html and css by now. I'll showcase these skills by building a landing page with odin specifications.
I will update this file after i am done.

Update:
I've completed the landing page. I followed the guidelines provided as accurately as i could. With slight modifications.
I used flexbox position and style everything. I have a better understanding of flexbox and its properties. Good for me.

My sources include:
